# Why use quarto for GitHub Pages docs?

*This page is generated by an LLM*

You’d consider Quarto for user manuals on GitHub Pages if you want a **repeatable, automated docs pipeline** rather than hand-crafted web pages. In practice, it helps most if your manuals are versioned, somewhat technical, or need to stay in sync with code.

Here are the main reasons.

### 1. Reproducible, versioned docs with your code

- Manuals live **in the same repo** as your code or pipelines.
- You write in plain text (Markdown, R Markdown, Jupyter, etc.), commit, and Quarto renders them to a static site that GitHub Pages serves.
- Each branch or tag of the repo can correspond to a specific version of the manual, so docs can track e.g. pipeline versions.

When it helps:

- Lab workflows or bioinformatics pipelines that keep changing.
- You want “the docs for release v1.2.3” to be reproducible from the repo state.

### 2. Single source, many outputs (HTML, PDF, etc.)

- Quarto can build **HTML for GitHub Pages**, but also **PDF (via LaTeX), Word, or slides** from the same source.
- You avoid copy–pasting between “online help,” “handout PDF,” and “slide deck for training.”

When it helps:

- Onboarding new lab members with a mix of web manuals, printable guides, and training slides.

### 3. Nice structure and navigation “for free”

- You define a **simple YAML project file** that describes the site (chapters, sections, sidebar).
- Quarto handles navigation, table of contents, cross-references, citations, search (with some config), and consistent styling.
- You focus on content, not HTML or CSS.

When it helps:

- You want something that feels like a **small docs site / book** rather than a loose set of Markdown files.

### 4. Good for technical and computational examples

- First-class support for **executable code blocks** (R, Python, Julia, etc.) if you ever want that.
- You can show examples, figures, and outputs generated directly from code and data, ensuring they stay up to date when you re-render.

When it helps:

- Manuals for analysis workflows, QC steps, data formats, or example analyses.

If you do not need executable code, you can still just write plain Markdown and ignore that part.

### 5. Automation and CI fit nicely with GitHub

- You can wire Quarto to **GitHub Actions** so that on every push to `main` (or to a `docs` branch), the site re-builds and redeploys automatically.
- This makes it low-friction to keep manuals current: update text, commit, push, done.

When it helps:

- Multiple contributors updating manuals.
- You want docs updates reviewed by PR like code.

### 6. Separation of content from presentation

- Styling, logos, and layout live in a small number of config/theme files.
- The actual manual content stays in **clean, readable text** that is easy to review in diffs.
- If later you change branding or layout, you do it once and rebuild.

When it helps:

- You expect the look and feel to evolve, but you do not want to rewrite content each time.

### 7. Why *not* use Quarto?

You might *not* want Quarto if:

- You just need **one or two simple static pages** that rarely change. Plain Markdown in GitHub Pages or a simple README might be enough.
- You want fully WYSIWYG editing by non-technical users with no interest in Git, Markdown, or PRs.
- Your users will only ever consume **PDF** and you are happy writing in Word or Google Docs.

If you tell me roughly what your “LGR team documentation framework” should look like (size of manual, who edits it, how technical the audience is), I can sketch a concrete “yes or no” on Quarto for your case and, if yes, the rough repo structure you’d use.
