    "text": "hy use quarto for GitHub Pages docs?\nThis page is generated by an LLM\nYou’d consider Quarto for user manuals on GitHub Pages if you want a repeatable, automated docs pipeline rather than hand-crafted web pages. In practice, it helps most if your manuals are versioned, somewhat technical, or need to stay in sync with code.\nHere are the main reasons.\n\n1. Reproducible, versioned docs with your code\n\nManuals live in the same repo as your code or pipelines.\nYou write in plain text (Markdown, R Markdown, Jupyter, etc.), commit, and Quarto renders them to a static site that GitHub Pages serves.\nEach branch or tag of the repo can correspond to a specific version of the manual, so docs can track e.g. pipeline versions.\n\nWhen it helps:\n\nLab workflows or bioinformatics pipelines that keep changing.\nYou want “the docs for release v1.2.3” to be reproducible from the repo state.\n\n\n\n2. Single source, many outputs (HTML, PDF, etc.)\n\nQuarto can build HTML for GitHub Pages, but also PDF (via LaTeX), Word, or slides from the same source.\nYou avoid copy–pasting between “online help,” “handout PDF,” and “slide deck for training.”\n\nWhen it helps:\n\nOnboarding new lab members with a mix of web manuals, printable guides, and training slides.\n\n\n\n3. Nice structure and navigation “for free”\n\nYou define a simple YAML project file that describes the site (chapters, sections, sidebar).\nQuarto handles navigation, table of contents, cross-references, citations, search (with some config), and consistent styling.\nYou focus on content, not HTML or CSS.\n\nWhen it helps:\n\nYou want something that feels like a small docs site / book rather than a loose set of Markdown files.\n\n\n\n4. Good for technical and computational examples\n\nFirst-class support for executable code blocks (R, Python, Julia, etc.) if you ever want that.\nYou can show examples, figures, and outputs generated directly from code and data, ensuring they stay up to date when you re-render.\n\nWhen it helps:\n\nManuals for analysis workflows, QC steps, data formats, or example analyses.\n\nIf you do not need executable code, you can still just write plain Markdown and ignore that part.\n\n\n5. Automation and CI fit nicely with GitHub\n\nYou can wire Quarto to GitHub Actions so that on every push to main (or to a docs branch), the site re-builds and redeploys automatically.\nThis makes it low-friction to keep manuals current: update text, commit, push, done.\n\nWhen it helps:\n\nMultiple contributors updating manuals.\nYou want docs updates reviewed by PR like code.\n\n\n\n6. Separation of content from presentation\n\nStyling, logos, and layout live in a small number of config/theme files.\nThe actual manual content stays in clean, readable text that is easy to review in diffs.\nIf later you change branding or layout, you do it once and rebuild.\n\nWhen it helps:\n\nYou expect the look and feel to evolve, but you do not want to rewrite content each time.\n\n\n\n7. Why not use Quarto?\nYou might not want Quarto if:\n\nYou just need one or two simple static pages that rarely change. Plain Markdown in GitHub Pages or a simple README might be enough.\nYou want fully WYSIWYG editing by non-technical users with no interest in Git, Markdown, or PRs.\nYour users will only ever consume PDF and you are happy writing in Word or Google Docs.\n\n\nIf you tell me roughly what your “LGR team documentation framework” should look like (size of manual, who edits it, how technical the audience is), I can sketch a concrete “yes or no” on Quarto for your case and, if yes, the rough repo structure you’d use."
